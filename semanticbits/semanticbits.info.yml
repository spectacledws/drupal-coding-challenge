description: 'Custom module for semanticbits coding challenge. Module should 
              create a block that lists all nodes modified on the current day 
              (today). This module has two block options, one block is created 
              via a view and another is created in a block plugin. The view 
              creation is the preferred way since it leverages existing Drupal 
              core modules, reduces code size, and provides a handy user 
              interface for changes if any need to be made. But since this a 
              coding challenge I figured you would want the custom block code, so 
              I did that too.'
